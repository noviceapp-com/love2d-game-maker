If you're reading this, you're probably wondering why there's a folder filled with files with numeric names.

Quite simply, these are actions. What are actions? Actions are simply code bits that are used in the code generation
process Love Game Maker runs through when you build your game. They're what you use in the program to do pretty much
anything to your game's objects.

Guess what? Love Game Maker was purposely programmed so you can make your own!

Although these files appear to be in a custom format (They carry the .action extension.), these
are just regular text (.txt) files that can be opened in any regular text editor. They were simply named with the .action
extension to prevent newbies with no knowledge of lua coding from accidentially messing with them, and having to re-download
LGM.

The correct format for the actions along with a guide on how to make your own will be detailed in the wiki shortly.
For now, try digging around through these files to see if you can figure out how to make your own. :)

Oh, and that categories.txt file? That defines the categories actions can be placed in.
